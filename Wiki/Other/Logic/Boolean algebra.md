**Boolean algebra** is a type of algebra that expresses logical operations.
## NOT
Not is shown with the $\lnot$ symbol.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lnot{1} = 0 \\
\widetilde \\ A = Q \\
\lnot{A} = Q
\end{aligned}
$$
## AND
And is shown with the $\land$ symbol.
$$
\begin{aligned}
1 \land 1 = 1 \\
1 \land 0 = 0 \\
0 \land 1 = 0 \\
0 \land 0 = 0 \\
A \cdot B = Q \\
A \land B = Q
\end{aligned}
$$
## OR
Or is shown with the $\lor$ symbol.
$$
\begin{aligned}
1 \lor 1 = 1 \\
1 \lor 0 = 1 \\
0 \lor 1 = 1 \\
0 \lor 0 = 0 \\
A + B = Q \\
A \lor B = Q
\end{aligned}
