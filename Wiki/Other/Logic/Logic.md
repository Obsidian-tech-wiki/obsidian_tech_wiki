Logic in a computer is the process of decision making. It is the process of making decisions based on the input given to the computer

## Logic in programming
Logic is heavily used in programming

```c
if (condition) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
```

In programs like the one above, the computer makes a decision based on the condition given to it. If the condition is true, it will execute the code in the `if` block, otherwise it will execute the code in the `else` block.
