A **list** is a data structure that consists of different data types and can contain the same item twice.

### Example
In this example we will use [[Python|python]].
```python
example_list = [1, "Apple", True, 2 , "Orange"]
```

Python tells us its a list.
```
>>> type(example_list)
<class 'list'>
```
