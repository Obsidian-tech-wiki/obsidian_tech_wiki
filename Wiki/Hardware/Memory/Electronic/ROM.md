**ROM** (Read only memory) can be read from but not written to. This makes it ideal to store instructions that cant be corrupted for example the [[BIOS]] or [[UEFI]] system. ROM is usually written to from the manufacture and cannot overwritten.

### [[OTPROM]]

Similar to [[PROM]] but only one time programable.

### [[EPROM]]
Main wiki page: [[EPROM]]
Erasable [[PROM]] that can be erased using UV light.

### [[EEPROM]]
