**Redirected from:** *Hard disk drive*
<hr>

A **Hard Disk Drive** (HDD) is a traditional magnetic storage device that uses rapidly rotating disks to read and write data. HDDs are known for their high storage capacity and relatively low cost. Storage capacity for HDDs can range from 500 GB to 16 TB or more, with read and write speeds generally between 80-160 MB/s.

## Typical specification
| Specification    | Value          |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Storage Capacity | 500 GB - 16 TB |
| Read Rate        | 80-160 MB/s    |
| Write Rate       | 80-160 MB/s    |
## How it works
The HDD consists of one or more spinning disks coated with a magnetic material. The data is written on the disk using a magnetic head that moves across the disk's surface. When there is power applied to the disk, the disk spins at a high speed, and the magnetic head reads or writes data to the disk.
