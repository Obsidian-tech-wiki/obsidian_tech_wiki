A **Hard Disk Drive** (HDD) is a traditional magnetic storage device that uses rapidly rotating disks to read and write data. HDDs are known for their high storage capacity and relatively low cost. Storage capacity for HDDs can range from 500 GB to 16 TB or more, with read and write speeds generally between 80-160 MB/s.
