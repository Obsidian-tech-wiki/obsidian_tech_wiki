**Secondary memory** or also known as secondary storage is non volatile. It is used to store programs and data. There are many types of secondary memory. Over the years we have change what secondary memory methods we use.

Not all computers require secondary memory. Computers such as [[embedded computers]] may not need secondary memory and can rely off [[ROM]].

## Volatile and non-volatile

Secondary memory is used to store data that is not currently being used. It is non-volatile, meaning that the data is still there even if the computer was switched off. This is different to [[primary memory]] which is volatile. This means that the data is lost when the computer is switched off.

## Performance and capacity

Over the years, the performance and capacity of secondary memory has increased on many on many types of secondary memory. This has allowed us to store more data and access it faster. One notable example is the [[SSD]] which is faster than the traditional [[HDD]] and has a far greater capacity per unit compared to the [[HDD]].

## Types
