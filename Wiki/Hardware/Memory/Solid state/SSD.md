A **Solid-State Drive** (SSD) is a type of data storage device that uses [[NAND]]-based flash memory to store data. SSDs are known for their high read and write speeds, low latency, and durability. The storage capacity of SSDs can range from 120 GB to several terabytes, with read and write speeds reaching over 500 MB/s.
