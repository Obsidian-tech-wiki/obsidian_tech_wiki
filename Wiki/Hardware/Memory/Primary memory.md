**Primary memory** or main memory is a part of memory that the [[CPU]] can directly access. 
## Types of primary memory
There are two types of primary memory
- [[ROM|Read only memory]]
- [[RAM|Random access memory]]

Rom is non volatile where as [[RAM]] is volatile. This means that when the [[computer]] is turned off the contents of [[RAM]] is lost.
