A **Compact Disc** or CD for short is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]]. It was first introduced in 1982 and quickly became a popular medium for storing and distributing digital audio and later, other forms of data. CDs typically have a storage capacity of about 700 MB and a read rate of approximately 150 KB/s.
