Computer architecture is the structure of the computer system. A computer architecture may include the [[instruction set]] or the logic design.

When designing a computer architecture there needs to be some design goals:
- Performance
- Power efficiency 

## Common computer architectures
- [[arm]] - 32-bit Advanced [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] Machine
- [[arm64]] - 64-bit Advanced [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] Machine
- [[ia32]] - 32-bit [[Intel]] Architecture
- [[mips]] - 32-bit [[Microprocessor]]
- [[mipsel]] - 64-bit [[Microprocessor]]
- [[ppc]] - [[PowerPC]] Architecture
- [[ppc64]] - 64-bit [[PowerPC]] Architecture
- [[s390]] - 31-bit The [[IBM]] System/390
- [[s390x]] - 64-bit The [[IBM]] System/390
- [[i386]] - 32-bit extended systems
- [[x86_64]] - 64-bit extended systems
