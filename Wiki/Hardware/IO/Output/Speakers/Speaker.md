A **Speaker** or **Speakers** turn digital or analog signals into sound. Speakers work on the principal of electromagnetism; where when a current is passed through a wire a magnetic field is generated around that wire.

Speakers use this principal to move a membrane which in turn vibrates the air around it to generate what we perceive as sound, and by changing the amperage you can change to output sound generated.
