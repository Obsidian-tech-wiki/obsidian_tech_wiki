A **display** is used by the computer to output information to the user. This can be done using several methods.

## Types of displays
There are various types of displays that have been used over the years. Here are some displays:

- [[Cathode ray tube display]]
- [[Light-emitting diode display]]
- [[Electroluminescent display]]
- [[Electronic paper]]
- [[Plasma display panel]]
- [[Liquid crystal display]]
- [[High-Performance Addressing display]]
- [[Thin-film transistor display]]
- [[Organic light-emitting diode display]]
- [[Digital Light Processing display]]
- [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display]]
- [[Field emission display]]
- [[Laser TV]]
- [[Carbon nanotubes]]
- [[Quantum dot display]]
- [[Interferometric modulator display]]
- [[Digital microshutter display]]
- [[microLED]]
- [[Swept-volume display]]
- [[Laser display]]
- [[Holographic display]]
- [[Light field displays]]
- [[Ticker tape]]
- [[Split-flap display]]
- [[Flip-disc display]]
- [[Vane display]]
- [[Rollsign]]
- [[Tactile electronic displays]]

## CRTs

We used to use CRT (Cathode ray tube) monitors, these are the big monitors that were used before flat-screens.
They worked on the principal that when an electron hits a phosphor; which the screen is coated in, lights up for a short period of time.

The electrons are emitted by a small metal element at the back of the display that is heated, they are then accelerated by a potential difference across the anode(A metal plate with a hole through the middle) and the cathode(The top part of the element)

The electrons are directed to a particular pixel on the screen via electro-magnets, this process needs to happen thousands of times per second as it need to hit every individual pixel between 50 and 60 times per second (depending on where the display is from Europe: 50 USA: 60) otherwise the image will fade.
