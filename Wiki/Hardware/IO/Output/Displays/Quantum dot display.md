**Quantum dot display** (QLED) displays are credited for having the best colours and brightness out of any display technology.

Theses colours are created by passing blue light through different quantum particles named quantum dots (QD), these QDs absorb the blue light and then emit either red, green or blue light depending on which quantum dots are present. The brightness of each pixel is controlled directly greatly reducing pixel response times.
