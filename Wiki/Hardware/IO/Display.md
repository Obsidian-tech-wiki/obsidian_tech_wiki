## CRTs

We used to use CRT (Cathode ray tube) monitors, these are the big monitors that were used before flat-screens.
They worked on the principal that when an electron hits a phosphor; which the screen is coated in, lights up for a short period of time.

The electrons are emitted by a small metal element at the back of the display that is heated, they are then accelerated by a potential difference across the anode(A metal plate with a hole through the middle, approximately half way between the element and screen) and the cathode(The part of the element that emits the electrons)

The electrons are directed to a specific pixel on the screen via electro magnets
