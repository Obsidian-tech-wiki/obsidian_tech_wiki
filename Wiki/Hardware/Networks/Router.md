A **router** is a networking device that forwards data between computer networks. It operates at the OSI model's network layer and makes decisions based on [[IP address|IP addresses]]
## Functionality
Routers often come with many functions to allow a computer network to run.
### Packet Forwarding 
Routers examine the destination IP address of a packet and determine the best path to forward it to its destination.

### Routing Tables
Routers maintain routing tables, which are used to make decisions about where to send data packets.

### Network Address Translation (NAT)
Many routers perform NAT, allowing multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.

### Firewall
Routers often include firewall capabilities to enhance network security.
