A **router** is a networking device that forwards data between computer networks. It operates at the OSI model's network layer and makes decisions based on [[IP address|IP addresses]]

## Functionality

**Packet Forwarding :**
Routers examine the destination IP address of a packet and determine the best path to forward it to its destination.

**Routing Tables:** 
Routers maintain routing tables, which are used to make decisions about where to send data packets.

**Network Address Translation (NAT):** 
Many routers perform NAT, allowing multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.

**Firewall:** 
Routers often include firewall capabilities to enhance network security.
