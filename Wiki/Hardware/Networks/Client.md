A **client** is a device that sends and receives data to and from the [[Server|server]]. Its main role is to allow the user to control the server. A example of a client is a web browser.

## Types of clients
There are three main types of clients these are thick clients, thin clients, or diskless nodes.
### Thick client
*See main wiki page: **[[Thick client]]***
A thick client does not rely much on the server and does most of the processing on the client.
### Thin client
*See main wiki page: **[[Thin client]]***
A thin client mostly relies on the server for data processing and calculations. A thin client doesn't need much processing power to run since most of the work is done on the server.
### Diskless node
*See main wiki page: **[[Diskless node]]***
A diskless node is similar to a fat client but stores all the data in the server and not local.
