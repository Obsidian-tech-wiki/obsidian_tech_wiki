Computer architecture is the structure of the [[Computer]] system. A [[Computer]] architecture may include the [[instruction set]] or the logic design.

When designing a [[Computer]] architecture there needs to be some design goals:
- Performance
- Power efficiency 
- Cost
- Reliability
- Scalability

## Common computer architectures
