There are many factors that affect [[CPU]] performance these are:
- [[#CPU Cores]]
- [[#Clock speed]]
- [[#Cache]]
- [[#Memory Bandwidth]]
- [[#Word length]]

## CPU Cores
**See main article:** *[[CPU Cores]]*

Having more cores in a CPU can increase the performance of the CPU. This is because the CPU can perform more tasks at the same time. This is especially useful for multitasking and parallel processing.

## Clock speed
**See main article:** *[[Clock speed]]*

The clock speed of a CPU is the speed at which it can process instructions. The higher the clock speed, the faster the CPU can process instructions. This is why a CPU with a higher clock speed is generally faster than a CPU with a lower clock speed.

## Cache
**See main article:** *[[Cache]]*

Cache is a small amount of memory that is built into the CPU. It is used to store frequently accessed data and instructions so that the CPU can access them quickly. The more cache a CPU has, the faster it can access data and instructions, which can improve performance.

## Memory Bandwidth
**See main article:** *[[Memory Bandwidth]]*

Memory bandwidth is the speed at which the CPU can access data from memory. The higher the memory bandwidth, the faster the CPU can access data, which can improve performance.

## Word length
**See main article:** *[[Word length]]*

A CPU's word length is the number of bits it can process at a time. The larger the word length, the more data the CPU can process at once, which can improve performance.
