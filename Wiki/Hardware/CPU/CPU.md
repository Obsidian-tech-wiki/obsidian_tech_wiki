The CPU is the **central processing unit**. It runs the It programs and performs calculations. The CPU can also be called the **main processor**. In the [[Computer]] the CPU is the most important processor. The CPU can perform calculations such as [[arithmetic]], [[Logic|logic]], controlling and [[IO]] operations. The CPU also talks to other main components such as [[RAM]], [[GPU]] and the [[network card]].

Over the years CPU's have become much faster and can compute more tasks at once. Their main purposes and operation hasn't changed.
