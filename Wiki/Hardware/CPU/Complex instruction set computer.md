**Complex instruction set computer** (CISC) is a [[instruction set]] where it can perform numerous low-level instructions. CISC makes the program size smaller by reducing the amount of instructions needed to reform a task but comes at a cost of more cycles per program.

## CPU architectures that use CISC
- [[x86_64]]
- [[Motorola 68000]]
- [[Intel 8068]]
- [[iAPX 432]]
### x86
The x86 architecture is the most common CISC architecture used in most computers today because it is the most compatible with the software that is currently available and is the most widely used architecture.
