Description: The rate at which a CPU can process instructions.

**CPU clock speed** is the speed at which a [[CPU]] can process instructions. It is measured in Hertz (Hz), which is the number of cycles per second. The higher the clock speed, the more instructions the CPU can process per second.
## Performance
The clock speed of a CPU is one of the main factors that determines the performance of a CPU. However, it is not the only factor. The number of cores and the architecture of the CPU also play a role in determining the performance of a CPU.

## Overclocking

Overclocking is the process of increasing the clock speed of a CPU. This is done by increasing the voltage of the CPU, which increases the amount of power that the CPU can use. 

### Overclocking dangers
This can increase the performance of the CPU, but it can also damage the CPU if it is not done correctly. Failing to provide adequate cooling can cause the CPU to overheat, which can damage the CPU and other components in the computer.

The computer will also use more power when overclocking, which will require a more powerful power supply. This will increase the cost of the computer and the cost of running the computer.

Overclocking can also void the warranty of the CPU, so it is important to check the warranty before overclocking a CPU.

## Under clocking
Under clocking is the process of decreasing the clock speed of a CPU. This is done by decreasing the voltage of the CPU, which decreases the amount of power that the CPU can use.

This can decrease the performance of the CPU, but it can also decrease the power consumption of the CPU. This can be useful for laptops, as it can increase the battery life of the laptop.

Under clocking is commonly done on [[smartphones]] and [[Laptop|laptops]] that use power saving mode.
