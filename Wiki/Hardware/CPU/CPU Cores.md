Description: A way of increasing the performance of a CPU by adding more processing units.
---
**CPU cores** are the individual processing units within a [[CPU]]. The more cores a CPU has, the more instructions it can process at once. This can increase the performance of the CPU, but it can also increase the power consumption of the CPU.

## Multi core processing
Multicore processing allows the computer to compute multiple instructions at once. This can increase the performance of the computer especially when running multiple programs at once. However, not all programs can take advantage of multicore processing. For example, a single threaded program can only run on one core at a time, so it will not benefit from multicore processing.

A [[Wiki/Software/Operating systems/Operating system|operating system]] kernel can also split single threaded programs across multiple cores.

## Hyper threading
Hyper threading is a technology developed by Intel that allows a single core to run two threads at once. This can increase the performance of the CPU.
