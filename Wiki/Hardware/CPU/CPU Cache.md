Description: A type of memory for the central processing unit.
---
**CPU cache** is a type of memory for the central processing unit. It is used to store frequently used data and instructions. This can increase the performance of the CPU.

This allows the cpu to access data and instructions faster than if it had to access them from [[RAM]]. This is because the CPU cache is closer to the CPU than RAM which makes the time to access the RAM longer than the time to access the CPU cache.

[[Apple M1]], [[Apple M2]] and [[Apple M3]] place the RAM on the same chip as the CPU. This means that the CPU cache is closer to the CPU than the RAM. This allows the computer to run really fast and efficiently.
 
## Types of CPU Cache
There are three levels of CPU cache:
- L1
- L2
- L3

### L1 Cache
L1 cache is the fastest type of cache. It is built into the CPU and is the smallest type of cache.

### L2 Cache
L2 cache is the second fastest type of cache. It is built into the CPU and is larger than L1 cache.

### L3 Cache
L3 cache is the slowest type of cache. It is not built into the CPU and is the largest type of cache.
