A [[machine architecture]] [[instruction set]] that has reduced instructions so they can be computed much faster within the CPU without needing to use [[memory]] as often. This is in contrast to a [[CISC]] [[instruction set]] which has a larger set of instructions that are more complex and require more memory to execute. The [[RISC]] [[instruction set]] is commonly used in modern [[CPU]]s and mainly used in [[embedded systems]] and [[mobile devices]]
## Performance
A RISC [[instruction set]] has the ability to execute one instruction per clock cycle, which is why it is faster than a [[CISC]] [[instruction set]]. This makes it more efficient for the CPU to execute instructions, as it can execute them faster and with less power consumption.
