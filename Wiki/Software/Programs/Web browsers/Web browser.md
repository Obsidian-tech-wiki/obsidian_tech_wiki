A **web browser** is a computer [[Program|program]] that allows users to access and view [[Website|website]] on the [[World wide web|world wide web]]. The most popular web browsers are [[Google Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari]], and [[Microsoft Edge]].

Web browsers commonly use the [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] to request and receive web pages from web servers. The pages are then displayed on the user's device, such as a computer or smartphone. Web browsers can also display other types of content, such as images, videos, and interactive elements.

Web browsers have many features to enhance the user's browsing experience, such as bookmarks, history, and tabbed browsing. They also support plugins and extensions that add additional functionality to the browser.

## History
The first web browser was created by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1990. It was called WorldWideWeb and was later renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the World Wide Web itself. The first popular web browser was [[Netscape Navigator]], released in 1994. It was followed by [[Internet Explorer]] from Microsoft and [[Firefox]].
