A **Star network** is a type of [[Network topology|network topology]] that uses a central node that keeps the [[MAC address]] and their [[IP address]] so that other computers can talk to each other. If a computer would like to talk to another computer on the network then it will route the traffic trough the central node which then routes the traffic to the right computer. A central node is typically a [[Switch|switch]] or a [[Router|router]]

## Advantages
A star network is a robust network topology meaning that if one cable fails only one computer can go down. A star network also has higher performance compared to a [[Bus network|bus network]] and has less issues with collisions in the network. A star network is also more secure compared to a bus network since all the messages are being sent to the central node and cant be intercepted by other computers.

## Disadvantages
If the central node goes down then the entire network cant talk to one another since the central node is required for a star network to work. A star network can also be expensive to setup and install since there will be more cable required and the central node may be expensive to install and run.
