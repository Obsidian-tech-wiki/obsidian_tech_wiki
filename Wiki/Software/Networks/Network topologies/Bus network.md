A **Bus network** is a type of [[Network topology|network topology]] that consists of all the devices being connected to a single cable and the ends of the cable are plugged into a terminator.
![[Bus network model]]

## Advantages
Using a bus network is not expensive to install and setup since it will require less cabling than a [[Star network|star network]].

## Disadvantages
Since all the devices are using the same cable if there is a failure in the cable than the network will be completely taken down and since all the traffic is going trough one cable it makes it easier for computers to see all the other traffic in the network. A bus network can also struggle in performance if there is lots of traffic.
