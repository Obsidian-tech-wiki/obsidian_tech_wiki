A **Local area network** (LAN) is a network that typically covers a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus. A LAN network typically consists of computers, [[Printer|printers]], [[Scanner|scanners]] and sometimes a central [[Server|server]]. Devices on a LAN network will be given a private [[IP address]].
