A **network** refers to a collection of interconnected devices or nodes that can share resources, information, and services. Networks play a crucial role in modern society, enabling communication, data exchange, and collaboration on a global scale.
## Key Components of a Network
- **Nodes:** Nodes are the individual devices or components connected within a network. These can include computers, servers, routers, switches, smartphones, and more.
- **Connections:** The connections between nodes are established through various technologies, such as wired (e.g., [[Ethernet]] cables) or wireless (e.g., [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Cellular networks|cellular networks]]) means.
- **Protocols:** Networks rely on specific communication protocols that define the rules and conventions for data exchange. Common protocols include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
