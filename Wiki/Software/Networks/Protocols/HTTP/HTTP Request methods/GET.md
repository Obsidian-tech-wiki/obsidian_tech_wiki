The **GET** request is used to retrieve data from a [[server]]. It is a read-only operation and doesn't change the state of the server. Typically, you use GET to request information from a web server, like fetching a webpage or an [[Application programming interface|API]] response.

The GET request is one of the most common [[HTTP methods]] and is used to retrieve data from a server.
##  Example
Here is an example of a GET request:

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
```
This does a simple  GET request to the server for the `index.html` file.
