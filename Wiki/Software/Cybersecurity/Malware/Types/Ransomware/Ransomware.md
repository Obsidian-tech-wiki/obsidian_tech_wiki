**Ransomware** is a type of malware that [[Encryption|encrypts]] a victim's files and demands a ransom payment for decryption. It can lock users out of their systems or leak sensitive data.

Ransomware is a very common type of malware since can cause lots of damage to computers and companies and give the attacker a high money return. A good example of malware was the 2017 wannacry (wanna cryptor) ransomware attack that affected many computers with the eternal blue [[Vulnerability|vulnerability]] on [[Microsoft windows|windows]] computers.
