## Security risks
Symmetric encryption is [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] to a [[Man in the middle|man in the middle]] since the key has to be on the receivers end and needs to be sent over the [[Internet|internet]] if they have not got it. When the key and message is being sent an attacker can sniff out the message and key if the [[Network|network]] is not secure.
