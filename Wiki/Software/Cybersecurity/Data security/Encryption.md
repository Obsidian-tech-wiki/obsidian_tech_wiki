**Encryption** is where text is turned into a format that cannot be understood without it being decrypted first. The original data is known as plaintext and the encrypted format is called cypher text. 

## Types of encryption
### Symmetric encryption
**See main wiki page:** *[[Symmetric encryption]]*
Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption that is also known as private key encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.
### Asymmetric encryption
**See main wiki page:** *[[Asymmetric encryption]]*
Asymmetric encryption uses two separate keys that have a relation to each other that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text. One key is a public key and the other is a private key.
