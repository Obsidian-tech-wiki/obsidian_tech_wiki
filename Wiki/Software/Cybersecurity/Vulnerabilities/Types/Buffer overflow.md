A buffer overflow is a security [[Vulnerability|vulnerability]] that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (a temporary storage area) than it can hold. This can lead to overwriting adjacent memory locations, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. It's a common target for exploitation in cybersecurity.
