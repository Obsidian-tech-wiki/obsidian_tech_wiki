**Redirected from:** *Vulnerable*

A **vulnerability** is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance. Vulnerability is the intersection of three elements: a system susceptibility or flaw, attacker access to the flaw, and attacker capability to exploit the flaw. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerability is also known as the attack surface.

## Types

There are several types of vulnerabilities, each with their own unique characteristics. The following are common categories of vulnerabilities found in computer systems:

- [[Buffer overflow]]
- [[Cross-site scripting]]
- [[Denial of service]]
- [[Format string attack]]
- [[Integer overflow]]
- [[Privilege escalation]]
- [[SQL injection]]
- [[Stack overflow]]
- [[Use-after-free]]
- [[Zero-day exploit]]

## Detection

Vulnerability detection is the process of finding flaws in the design, implementation, and deployment of a system. It is integral to the [[vulnerability management]] lifecycle. Vulnerability detection is typically performed using a vulnerability scanner. A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, computer systems, networks or applications for weaknesses. There are several types of vulnerability scanners available on the market, some commercial, some free of charge, with various features and techniques. Vulnerability scanners can also be used to discover vulnerabilities in services running on a host, such as open ports and [[OS fingerprinting|operating system detection]].

## CVE

A [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVE) is a list of publicly disclosed information security vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE IDs are assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). CNAs include vendors, open-source projects, researchers, and individuals. Each CNA has a set of agreed-upon policies for how to assign CVE IDs, which include the identification of vulnerabilities, the assignment of short names for each vulnerability, and how to publicly announce vulnerabilities. The assignment of CVE IDs is not a guarantee that the vulnerability will be publicly announced or fixed.
