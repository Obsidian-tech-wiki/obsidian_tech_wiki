**Libraries** are collections of precompiled code deigned to simplify and optimise specific tasks
## Dynamic libraries:

This type of libraries are supposed to be used by lots of [[program|programs]] but are not added to the executable at compile time.
These libraries are usually in a central location.
E.G: `/usr/local/lib` on [[UNIX]] systems

The standard file extensions are:
	[[Microsoft windows|Windows]]: .dll
	[[MacOS]]: .dylib
	[[Linux]] and other [[UNIX]]: .so

Often to link this type of library to a compiler you need to specify the path to the file the library is in with -L and then specify the name of the library with -l; if the library name has lib at the start don't add that to the [[flag]]
E.G: `clang++ test.cpp -L libraries -l Test`
The file name of the library is libTest.dylib

## Static libraries:

This type of library is usually added within the project and is compiled with the program
But is not shared between multiple programs
The standard file extensions are:
	[[Microsoft windows|Windows]]: .lib
	[[UNIX]]: .a

Often to link this type of library to a compiler all you need to do is add the file in the command
E.G: `clang++ test.cpp libraries/libTest.a`
