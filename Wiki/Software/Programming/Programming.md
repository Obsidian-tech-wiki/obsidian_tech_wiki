**Programming** is where a person writes [[Software|software]] that runs on a computer.
## Programming constructs
There are three main programming constructs.
- Sequence
- Selection
- Iteration
### Sequence
Sequence is where one line is followed after another.
### Selection
Selection is where a program has logic and decides what instructions to run based on a result of something else.
### Iteration
Iteration is where a program loops over code. There are two types of iteration count-controlled iteration and condition-controlled iteration.
