An **interpreter** is a key component of a [[Interpreted programming language|interpreted programming language]] and translates the source code into [[Machine code|machine code]] and runs it.

## Process
The interpreter runs the code line by line and checks for syntax errors, if there are no errors on that line then it will turn it into byte code which is a language in between [[Source code]] and [[Machine code|machine code]]. Then the code is ran on the computer.
