**Pseudocode** is a type of structured English that is used to describe the logic of a program.
## Syntax
Pseudocode is not generally bound by any syntax rules, but it is generally written in a way that is easy to understand.

### Example
```
BEGIN
  PRINT "Hello, World!"
END
```

```
BEGIN
	WHILE true THEN
		a = INPUT "Enter a number: "
		IF a = 0 THEN
	      PRINT "You entered 0"
	    ELSE
	      PRINT "You entered a number other than 0"
	    END IF
	ENDWHILE
END
```
