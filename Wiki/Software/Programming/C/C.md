The **C** programming language is a versatile and widely-used [[Programming languages|programming language]] that has influenced numerous other languages. Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, C is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability. It has become a foundational language for system programming, embedded systems, and various application domains.

## History
C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardised by the [[ISO]] and [[ANSI]].

### Versions
The C programming language has evolved over time, with various versions of the language being released. The following table lists the various versions of the C programming language, along with their release dates and notable features.

- [[C89]] - 1989
- [[C99]] - 1999
- [[C11]] - 2011
- [[C18]] - 2018
- [[C23]] - 2024

## Standard libraries
C has a standard library that is specified by the [[ISO]] and [[ANSI]] standards. Each version of the C standard specifies a different standard library, with the most recent version having the most features and libraries.
