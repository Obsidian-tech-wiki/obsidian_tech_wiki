Python uses variables to store data for other functions. Variables in python can be changed and have any [[Python data types|data type]].
## Example
To create a variable you specify the name and the data to be put in the variable.
```python
my_variable = "Hello world!"
```

This variable can be rewritten to like this.

```python
my_variable = "Hello there!"
```

You can also append more data on to a variable like this.

```python
my_variable = my_variable + " How are you?"
```

Lets now try printing this.

```python
print(my_variable)
```

```
Hello there! How are you?
```
