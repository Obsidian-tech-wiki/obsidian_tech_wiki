A **program** is piece of [[software]] or a set of instructions that is run on a computer. A program is written in a programming language and then ran on the [[computer]] as a [[compiler|compiled]] program or [[Interpreted programming language|interpreted]].

Computer programs allow the [[computer]] to perform tasks and store them on the computers [[memory]] and run them later.

Programs have [[user interface]] this allows the user to interact with the program. Most [[User interface|user interfaces]] are graphical but some use a text based interface.
