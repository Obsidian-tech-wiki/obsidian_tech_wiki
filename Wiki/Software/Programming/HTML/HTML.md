**HTML** (hyper text markup language) is the standard markup language for webpages. HTML is the main structure of a web page and can consist of [[image|images]], [[Video|video]] and [[Text|text]]. A [[Web browser|web browser]] parses the web page and renders it on the screen. HTML can also include scripts that run on the page to add functionality. The scripts are written in javascript.
