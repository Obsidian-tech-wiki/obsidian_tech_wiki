**BIOS** (basic input output system) is the [[Firmware|firmware]] that initialises all the hardware and is ran before the [[Wiki/Software/Operating systems/Operating system|operating system]]. The BIOS provides basic functionality and finds the [[Wiki/Software/Operating systems/Operating system|operating system]] to boot to. The BIOS also performs a self test to check the components of the computer, this is called a [[POST]] (Power on self test).
