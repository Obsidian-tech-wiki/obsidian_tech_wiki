**Software testing** is where a software developer tests code and finds or fixes bugs. There are several types of software testing.

## Types of software testing
### Black box testing (function testing)
Black box testing is where a set of test data is used against the code and covers the inputs and functions of the code.

### White box testing (structural testing)
White box testing is dependent on the code logic. White box testing tests the program logic.
### Alpha testing
Alpha testing is carried out by software developers in the internal testing team. It is an important process of the testing since it can reveal lots of errors in the program.

### Beta testing
Beta testing is when the software is given to a handful of people and people give feedback on issues within the software.
