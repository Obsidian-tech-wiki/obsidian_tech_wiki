## Types
There are five types of kernels:
- A micro kernel
- A monolithic kernel
- A hybrid kernel
- Exokernel
- Nanokernel
### Microkernel
A microkernel is a type of kernel that has the minimum amount of software required to provide basic operating system functionality.

### Monolithic kernel
A Monolithic is a type of kernel that contains all the drivers for the operating system to work across lots of hardware in one kernel.

### Hybrid kernel
A hybrid kernel is a type of kernel that combines the idea of a microkernel and monolithic kernel into one kernel
