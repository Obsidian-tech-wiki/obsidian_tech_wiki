*Not to be confused with **[[Compact disk]] (CD)***
___
The **cd** command allows you to change your current working directory. The `cd` command is built right into the [[shell]] and is not a program 
## Example
In this example we change out directory to the wiki folder and back to the root of the wiki.
```
lewis@Lewiss-MacBook-Air obsidian_tech_wiki % cd Wiki
lewis@Lewiss-MacBook-Air Wiki % cd ..
lewis@Lewiss-MacBook-Air obsidian_tech_wiki %
```

## Shortcuts
You can use shortcuts to move to a special directory in the system.
- `/` - Move to the root of the dir.
- `~` - Move to your home or root folder (Can be used with only the `cd` command on its own).
- `..` - Move back a directory .
