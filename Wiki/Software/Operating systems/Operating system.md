A **operating system** (OS) is [[software]] that manages the [[Hardware]] or the [[Computer]]. It also provides common services for the operating system. The operating also manages the [[memory]] of the computer. A operating system would usually have a [[Operating system kernel|kernel]] that talks directly to the [[Hardware]]

## Types of operating systems
### Single tasking and multi tasking system
A single tasking system can only run one program at one time while a multi tasking operating system allows more than one [[Program]] to run. This can be done using time sharing where the [[CPU]] time is shared across the processors. 
 
Single user operating system have no ways to differentiate between users but may allow you to multitask. A multi-user operating system allows you to have several users to control a OS and a admin can manage the permissions.
### Real-time
A real time operating system is a system that needs to be able to process data in real time. This can be used if a system is reliant on data that has to be processed quickly. [[RTOS]] is an example of a real time operating system and is open source.
### Embedded operating system
A embedded operating system runs on a small [[Computer]] that is specialised for a small machine or component. These operating systems have limited functions and are programmed onto the [[ROM]] of the system.

## Functions of a operating system
The operating system has many functions and features but most operating systems have these key features:
- Memory management
- Processor management
- Device management
- File management
- User interface
- Network
- Error and system failure handling.
## Kernel
**Main wiki page:** *[[Kernel]]*
![[Kernel.png]]
A operating system kernel talks to the hardware and applications. It has complete control of the [[CPU]], [[RAM]], [[Input devices|input devices]] and [[Output devices]].
