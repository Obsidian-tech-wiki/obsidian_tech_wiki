**Compression** is the process of reducing the size of a file by encoding in a format or removing data that is not needed. This is done to save space on a disk or to reduce the time it takes to transfer a file over a network. There are two types of compression: lossy and lossless.

Compression is commonly used in [[Video|videos]], [[Image|images]] and [[Audio|audio]] and comes in many formats that can greatly reduce the file sizes.

## Lossy compression

Lossy compression is a type of compression that removes data from a file to reduce the file size. This is done by removing data that is not needed or that is not noticeable to the human eye. Lossy compression is used in [[JPEG]], [[MP3]] and [[MPEG]] files.

## Lossless compression

Lossless compression is a type of compression that reduces the file size without losing any data. This is done by encoding the data in a more efficient way. Lossless compression is used in [[ZIP]], [[GIF]] and [[PNG]] files.
