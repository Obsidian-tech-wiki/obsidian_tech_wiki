A **Markup language** is a language that is used to define the structure of a document. There are many types of markup languages that are used for different purposes.

## Types
- [[HTML]] - For websites and webpages
- [[Markdown]] - For documentation and text files
- [[MediaWiki]] - For wikis
- [[LaTeX]] - For scientific documents

## Example
A good example of a markup language is markdown which is used to write text files that can be easily converted to HTML and other formats. It is also very human readable.

```markdown
# This is a title
This is some text

## This is a subheading
This is some more text.
- This
- Is
- A
- List
```
