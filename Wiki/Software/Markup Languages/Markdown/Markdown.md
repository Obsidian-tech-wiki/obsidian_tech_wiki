**Markdown** is a [[Markup language|markup language]] that is used to write text files that can be easily 
converted to HTML and other formats. Markdown is often used for writing documentation and formatting messages in chat applications.

## Markup
Markdown is structured using a simple syntax that is easy to read and write. Here are some examples of the syntax:


```markdown
# Title
This is some text.

## This is a subheading.
This is some more text.
- This
- Is
- A
- List

| Name  | Price |
| ----- | ----- |
| Egg   | £1    |
| Milk  | £2    |
| Flour | £1.50 |
| Sugar | £2    |

**This is bold**
*This is italic*
![Image](image.jpg)
[Link](https://example.com)
```

### Key elements
- `#` - This is used to define a heading.
- `-` - This is used to define a list.
- `|` - This is used to define the start of a table.
- `---` - This is used to define the header row, horizontal rule, or table row.
- `**` - This is used to define bold text.
- `*` - This is used to define italic text.
- `[]()` - This is used to define a link.
- `![]()` - This is used to define an image.
- `>` - This is used to define a blockquote.

#### Headings
Headings are defined in markdown using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols used determines the level of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

> [!note]+
> Headings can only go up to level 6

#### Lists
Lists are defined using the `-` symbol. There are two types of lists: ordered and unordered.

```markdown
- This is an unordered list
- This is another item in the list
```

```markdown
1. This is an ordered list
2. This is another item in the list
```

#### Tables
Tables are defined using the `|` symbol. The first row is used to define the headers, and the second row is used to define the alignment of the columns.

```markdown
| Name  | Price |
| ----- | ----- |
| Egg   | £1    |
| Milk  | £2    |
| Flour | £1.50 |
| Sugar | £2    |
```

#### Links
Links are defined using the `[` symbol followed by the text and the `]` symbol followed by the URL in parentheses.

```markdown
[Link](https://example.com)
```

#### Images
Images work in the same way as links but have a `!` at the start of the link to define the image. The text in the square brackets is the alt text for the image.

```markdown
![Image](image.jpg)
```

#### Blockquotes
Blockquotes are defined in markdown using the `>` symbol.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
```
