<hr>

**RFID (Radio frequency identification)**  uses electromagnetic fields to pickup objects that have a RFID tag on them. A RFID system usually has a [[Transponder|transponder]] in the tag, a radio receiver and a transmitter. Then the RFID chip is triggered by the pulse from the nearby RFID reader the RFID chip responds with some data.
## Examples
RFID chips are used in many applications here are some:
- Door entry systems
- Inventory systems
- Animal RFID chips
- Tags on items in shops to prevent shoplifting
- Locating lost baggage
- Toll collection

## Types of readers
There are different types of RFID readers these are:
- Passive RFID readers
- Active RFID readers
- Semi-passive RFID readers

### Passive RFID readers
Passive RFID readers are the most common type of RFID reader. They are powered by the RFID reader and do not have a battery. They are usually cheaper than active RFID readers. Passive RFID readers have a range of around 10 meters.

### Active RFID readers
Active RFID readers have a battery and are more expensive than passive RFID readers. They have a longer range than passive RFID readers. Active RFID readers have a range of around 100 meters.

### Semi-passive RFID readers
Semi-passive RFID readers are a mix of passive and active RFID readers. They have a battery but are powered by the RFID reader. They have a range of around 50 meters.
