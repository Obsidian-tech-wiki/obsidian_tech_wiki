Welcome to obsidian tech wiki. Before you start editing please read the guidelines.

## What this wiki is about?
This wiki is all about computer science and technology. This includes hardware, software, programming, networking, and more.

## How to edit this wiki
It is recommended that you use obsidian to edit this wiki in live preview mode. This allows you to see the changes you make in real time. 

### Extensions
To make editing this wiki far easier you should install the following plugins:
- Templater (See templates section lower down)
- Excalidraw (For diagrams)

### Wiki structure
The entire wiki is in the `wiki` folder. This is where all the markdown files are stored. The `attachments` folder is where all the images are stored.

Inside the wiki folder there is three main subfolders:
- `Hardware`
- `Software`
- `Other`

These folders are for the main categories of the wiki. Inside these folders are the subcategories.

Placing any new files in the correct folder is important. This is so the wiki is organized and easy to navigate.
### Templates
The wiki uses several templates to make editing easier. You can place in a template using templater. 

### Creating a new file
To create a new file a quick way is to use the template named `Default` which creates the file properties and bottom meta sections. Be sure to put your GitHub name in the authors section. Also make sure to put tags which should relate to the path or group of articles. For example if I am writing about `Machine Code` which is located in `Wiki/Software/Programming/Languages/` the page would be tagged with `Sofware` and `Programming`.
